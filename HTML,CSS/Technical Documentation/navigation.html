                <p style="font-size:200% ;font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, 
                  kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football
                   that is the most popular where the word is used. Sports commonly called football include association football 
                   (known as soccer in North America and Oceania); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); 
                   Australian rules football; rugby union and rugby league; and Gaelic football.
                   These various forms of football share to varying extent common origins and are known as football codes.</p>

                   <p style="font-size:200% ;font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played 
                    in many different parts of the world.Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of 
                    these games at English public schools during the 19th century. The expansion and cultural influence of the British
                     Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside the directly controlled Empire.
                      By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already developing: Gaelic football, for example,
                       deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage.
                        In 1888, The Football League was founded in England, becoming the first of many professional football associations. 
                        During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular team sports 
                        in the world.</p>

              <p style="font-size:200% ;font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Tennis is a racket sport that is played either individually against a single opponent (singles) or  
                between two teams of two players each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber
                 ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court. The object of the game is to manoeuvre the ball in such a 
                 way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. The player who is unable to return the ball validly will not gain a point, 
                 while the opposite player will. Tennis is an Olympic sport and is played at all levels of society and at all ages.
                  The sport can be played by anyone who can hold a racket, including wheelchair users. The modern game of tennis 
                  originated in Birmingham, England, in the late 19th century as lawn tennis.
                  It had close connections both to various field (lawn) games such as croquet and bowls as well as to the older 
                  racket sport today called real tennis. </p>

                 <p style="font-size:200% ;font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> The rules of modern tennis have changed little since the 1890s.
                   Two exceptions are that until 1961 the server had to keep one foot on the ground at all times,
                   and the adoption of the tiebreak in the 1970s.
                   A recent addition to professional tennis has been the adoption of electronic review technology coupled
                    with a point-challenge system, which allows a player to contest the line call of a point, a system known as Hawk-Eye.
